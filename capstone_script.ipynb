    "So, first thing is first - I need to scrape apartment listings from Apartments.com. Specifically, addresses and rent prices for 1-bedroom apartments in the Upper West Side (UWS) neighborhood of Manhattan, NYC.  As you can see here, Apartments.com is very logical in their url construction. The /neighborhood is followed by different filters, which in this case is /1-bedrooms.  The last part of the url includes the results page number.  Personally, 5 pages of results (25 listings per page * 5 = 125 search results) seemed like enough for a data science novice like me!"
